# **PacMan-Project**

## **Description** 
#### Just a basic working code example of pacman moving across the screen, hitting borders and moving back. Uses 4 different images and 2 functions with an array. The comments were kept in to keep the understanding of all the things happening in the code, in case I want to come back to it later.  

## **Installation** 
#### Download the files and then drag and drop pacman into your browser. 

## **Road Map** 
#### I most likely will not edit the code again, just a one time project unless I need it in the future!
